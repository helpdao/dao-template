# HelpDAO template â›‘

Aragon DAO Membership template with Agent.

Agent app allows the DAO to manage finances and even interact with DeFi. That would allow the DAO to earn interest in funds that aren't allocated yet, for example

You'll then need to configure it with three tokens:

- $DONOR: All donors get it, regardless of their contribution. This token allows them to be part of the help squad's group chat. As a last-resort measure, they can also replace supervisors
- $VOLUNTEER: Enables volunteers to ask for reimbursements to the DAO
- $SUPERVISOR: Enables supervisors to vote on approving reimbursements from volunteers, and also to vote on including or removing volunteers
