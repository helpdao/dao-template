# HelpDAO template â›‘

Aragon DAO Membership template with Agent.

Agent app allows the DAO to manage finances and even interact with DeFi. That would allow the DAO to earn interest in 
funds that aren't allocated yet, for example

It will be configured with one token:

- $SUPERVISOR: Enables supervisors to vote on approving reimbursements from volunteers, and also to vote on adding or 
removing volunteer permissions to create votes for claiming reimbursement.
